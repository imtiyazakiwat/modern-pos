# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement will improve the purchase invoice system by automatically appending GST number and tax information fields to the purchase notes when users enter data and save purchases. This will provide better record-keeping and compliance tracking for tax-related information in purchase transactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a purchase manager, I want GST number and tax information to be automatically appended to purchase notes, so that I can maintain comprehensive tax records for compliance and auditing purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a GST number in the purchase form THEN the system SHALL append "Supplier GST: [GST_NUMBER]" to the purchase notes
2. WHEN a user enters tax information in the purchase form THEN the system SHALL append "Tax Info: [TAX_INFORMATION]" to the purchase notes
3. WHEN both GST number and tax information are provided THEN the system SHALL append both pieces of information to the purchase notes with proper formatting
4. WHEN neither GST number nor tax information are provided THEN the system SHALL save the purchase notes without any additional tax-related information
5. WHEN existing purchase notes are present THEN the system SHALL append the tax information after the existing notes with proper line breaks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the GST and tax information fields to be clearly visible and accessible in the purchase form, so that I can easily enter this information when creating purchases.

4. WHEN a user submits the purchase form THEN the system SHALL include GST and tax field values in the form submission

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the GST and tax information to be properly formatted and stored in the database, so that the data can be retrieved and displayed consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN purchase data is exported or printed THEN the system SHALL include the complete notes with tax information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend and backend to be properly synchronized for GST and tax field handling, so that the data flows correctly from user input to database storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend form is submitted THEN the system SHALL properly serialize GST and tax field values
2. WHEN backend receives the form data THEN the system SHALL correctly extract GST and tax information from the request
3. WHEN processing purchase creation THEN the system SHALL validate that GST and tax fields are handled consistently
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate logging for GST and tax field processing
