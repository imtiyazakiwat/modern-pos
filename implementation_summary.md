# GST Number Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

1. Created `alter2.sql` to add a `gst_number` column to the `selling_info` table
2. Modified the invoice model to store GST numbers directly in the database instead of in the invoice note
3. Updated the template data function to include the GST number as a separate variable for templates
4. Created a migration script to extract GST numbers from existing invoice notes
5. Created instructions for updating invoice templates

## What You Need to Do

1. **Run the database migration**: 
   ```
   mysql -u your_username -p your_database < alter2.sql
   ```

2. **Run the migration script** to extract GST numbers from existing invoice notes:
   ```
   php migrate_gst_numbers.php
   ```
   Note: You may need to fix database connection settings in the script if you encounter errors.

3. **Update your invoice templates** to display the GST number:
   - Follow the instructions in `gst_template_instructions.md`
   - Find where customer name is displayed in your template
   - Add the GST number below it using the `{{ customer_gst_number }}` variable

4. **Test the implementation** by creating a new invoice with a GST number to ensure it displays correctly

## Benefits of This Approach

1. GST numbers are stored separately in the database for better organization
2. GST numbers can be easily queried and reported on
3. The display is more professional with the GST number appearing directly under the customer name
4. You have control over the styling and placement of the GST number in the templates
